    <h2>Wrestling is Scripted!!</h2>
    <p>Wrestling is scripted and i have proof</p>
    <p>If someone is being punched in the face hard there will be 100% contact</p>
    <p>but in wrestling(Pro wrestling too) before the hand even touches the face they are already on the ground</p>
    <p>I have a lot more proof but i got better things to do</p>
